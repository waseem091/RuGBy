# RuGBy - Color Bucket Generator for AllRGB Images

A Figma plugin designed to generate color buckets for creating AllRGB images. Each bucket contains 65,536 colors arranged in a perfect 256x256 grid.

## Features

- **Independent Component Locking**: Lock R, G, and B values separately using intuitive lock/unlock icons
- **Color Bucket Generation**: Creates frames named "cb-<R value>" for easy organization
- **256x256 Resolution**: Each frame is exactly 256x256 pixels for perfect PNG export
- **AllRGB Mission**: Generate 256 color buckets (one for each R value) to create complete AllRGB images

## How to Use

### Color Bucket Generation

1. **Set Initial Values**: Enter the starting RGB values (e.g., `00 00 00`)
2. **Set Final Values**: Enter the ending RGB values (e.g., `00 FF FF`)
3. **Lock Components**: 
   - ðŸ”’ **R Locked**: R value stays constant across the bucket
   - ðŸ”’ **G Locked**: G value stays constant across the bucket  
   - ðŸ”“ **B Unlocked**: B value varies to create color range
4. **Generate**: Click "GENERATE" to create the color bucket frame

### Lock System

- **ðŸ”’ Locked**: Component value is synchronized between initial and final
- **ðŸ”“ Unlocked**: Component value can vary independently
- **Click to Toggle**: Click any lock icon to toggle its state

### Typical Color Bucket Workflow

For generating complete AllRGB color buckets:

1. Start with R=00, G=00, B=00 (initial)
2. End with R=00, G=FF, B=FF (final)
3. Keep R and G locked (ðŸ”’ðŸ”’ðŸ”“)
4. Generate â†’ Creates "cb-00" frame with 65,536 colors
5. Change R to 01, repeat â†’ Creates "cb-01" frame
6. Continue for all R values (00-FF) â†’ 256 total buckets

### Export Settings

Each generated frame is automatically configured for PNG export at 256x256 resolution. Simply:

1. Select the frame
2. Right-click â†’ Export
3. Choose PNG format
4. Export at 1x scale for exact 256x256 pixels

## Technical Details

- **Frame Size**: Exactly 256x256 pixels for standard export
- **Color Count**: Up to 65,536 colors per frame (256Ã—256 grid)
- **Naming**: Frames named "cb-<RR>" where RR is the hex R value
- **Positioning**: Sequential vertical stacking of generated frames
- **Reset**: Use "Reset Position" to start fresh positioning

## AllRGB Image Creation

1. Generate all 256 color buckets (cb-00 through cb-FF)
2. Export each as PNG (256x256 resolution)
3. Combine all PNGs â†’ Complete AllRGB image (65,536Ã—256 pixels)

Each bucket represents one vertical slice of the final AllRGB image, with R constant and G,B varying across the full range.
